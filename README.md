## I am enthusiastically pursuing a PhD position in CS starting from 2026 fall!

Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Ruiqi Chen, I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in  [Human Centered Design & Engineering](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/) at the **University of Washington**, affiliated with [Makeability Lab](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/) by [Prof. Jon E. Froehlich](https://jonfroehlich.github.io/) and [ACE Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/acelab/index.html) by [Prof. Jacob O. Wobbrock](https://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/). I also collaborate closely with [Prof. Aditya Parameswaran](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~adityagp/) at **University of California, Berkeley**. Previously, I obtained my Dual B.S. degree in Data Science from Duke University and Duke Kunshan University, where I worked with [Prof. Xin Tong](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=XIM08ZwAAAAJ&hl=en) in [HCI Lab](https://arkxlab.github.io/).

My research lies at the intersection of Humanâ€“Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), combining human and machine intelligence to **train human-centered AI models** and **build human-centered AI systems**. My work bridges HCI and AI through the design of **AI-assisted tools** that empower rather than replace human intelligence. Over the past four years, my research has spanned human-centered AI, computer vision, large language and vision-language models, and machine learning.
