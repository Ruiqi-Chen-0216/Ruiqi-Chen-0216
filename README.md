## I am enthusiastically pursuing a PhD position in CS&HCI starting from 2026 fall!

Hi there 👋

I am Ruiqi Chen, I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in [Human Centered Design & Engineering](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington, affiliated with [Makeability Lab](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/) and [ACE Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/acelab/index.html). Previously, I received my Dual Bachelor’s degree in Data Science from Duke University and Duke Kunshan University in May 2024.

My research interests lie primarily at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction(HCI) and Artificial Intelligence(AI), combining human and machine intelligence to create interactive systems for accessibility, collaboration, and beyond. In my past three years of research experience, my research scope has included Human-Centered AI, Human-AI Collaboration, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Extended Reality (XR), and Virtual Reality (VR).
